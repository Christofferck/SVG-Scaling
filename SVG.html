    <p>What is a viewbox? <br>
        - The viewBox defines the position and dimension, in the user space, of an SVG viewport</p>
        <br>

    <p>What is a viewport?<br> 
    - The viewport is the part of the webpage that the we can currently see,
     The scrollbars move the viewport to show other parts of the webpage.</p>  
     <br>
     
     <p>How do they relate to each other? <br>
    - They relate to eachother by basicly being being a part of eachother, the viewbox is 
      important in terms of positioning and dimensions, which is a vital part in what the user sees
      on the page itself</p>
    <br>

    <p>How to scale an SVG drawing's appearance on a web page? <br>
    - We make use of Cx which is the X-axis <br>
    - We also make use of Cy, which is the Y-axis <br>
    - Rx defines the x-axis radius <br>
    - and Ry defines the Y-axis radius <br>
    - If you can combine all of the four above you should be able to properly scale an SVG on a webpage</p>
